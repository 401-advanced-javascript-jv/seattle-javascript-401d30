  "description": "## Environments  (`envs`)   * Open up the shell and talk about it being a place to run commands   * Run `code .` and explain that you're running an app called 'code' and telling it what file to do it's work with.  When you close it, you're back at the shell.   * Open up `bc` and do some math. Again, it's a place to run commands   * Open up `node` and you can run JS -- it starts up an environment that gets the ENV vars, memory, etc.  This *is* the console, effectively   * You can use the php shell (`php -a`), or the perl shell (`perl -dei`) and issue commands to those languages, too.   * Edit a file called `app.pl` that prints out \"hello from perl\"     * Run this will perl app.pl   * Repeat with app.php, app.py, etc   * Hammer in the point that perl, php, sh, python are all \"apps\" that:     * start up an \"environment\" not unlike your shell     * read in the file you tell them to open     * figure out what your code does (compile it)     * execute that code     * return you back to where you started   * Now, do it with a .js file, using node as the runner",
